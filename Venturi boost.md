# GhostDevol Intake Node

**Modular Air Orchestration System for NA and Turbo Platforms**

VenturiBoost is a forensic-grade intake system engineered for naturally aspirated and turbocharged engines. It uses dual-stage venturi geometry, AC-cooled coils, belt-driven pressure tanks, and resonance-tuned velocity stacks to deliver dense, responsive airflow without forced induction.

## 🔧 Configurations

- **VBoost-NA**: Performance mode for naturally aspirated engines  
- **EcoPulse**: Fuel efficiency mode with low-RPM tuning  
- **VBoost-Turbo**: Pre-turbo cooling for factory turbocharged platforms

## 🚗 Supported Platforms

- Ford Explorer 4.6L V8 (NA, dual exhaust)  
- Mazda CX-5 2.5L I4 (NA and Turbo variants)  
- Modular compatibility with Subaru FA20, Ford EcoBoost, and more

## 📊 Simulation Highlights

| Mode           | HP Gain     | Intake Temp Drop | Fuel Efficiency Gain |
|----------------|-------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| VBoost-NA      | +18–23 hp   | ~14°C            | +19.6% MPG  
| EcoPulse       | +0 hp       | ~13°C            | +19.4% MPG  
| VBoost-Turbo   | +19–24 hp   | ~25°C            | +7–10% combustion efficiency
